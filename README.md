Supplementary Material for the paper "A Difference Equation Based Approach for the Stability and Robustness of High-Order Compact Schemes for Variable Coefficient Parabolic PDEs"
The given algorithms compute the symbolic expressions for $D^1_N$, and give the symbolic/numerical values for the roots of $D^1_N$. Further, it makes use of the theorem to conclude the stability of the compact scheme under the specific choices of parameters entered by a user
